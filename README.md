Objective: learn to bulid a pipeline that can be used within a web/mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images by applying Convolutional Neural Networks.
 
The pipeline will identify an estimate of the dog breed if an image of a dog is given. If an image of a human is given, the pipeline will resemble dog breed.
